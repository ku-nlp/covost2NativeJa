train0116.mp3	The logic that the user is also responsible can only be called irresponsible.	train
train0117.mp3	There is a strong wind and biting cold on the shrine grounds.	train
train0118.mp3	She saved up just in case.	train

train0234.mp3	Buy one postcard at the post office.	train
train0235.mp3	Due to illness and with no other choice, he quit smoking.	train
train0236.mp3	Father continued to sing.	train
train0237.mp3	Above and to the right, there are clearly drawn lines that climb steeply.	train
train0238.mp3	I caught a cold.	train
train0239.mp3	She tried not to cry.	train
train0240.mp3	There’s no way this kind of picture can be drawn easily.	train
train0241.mp3	Father and I played tennis on Sunday.	train
train0242.mp3	Please add lots of ice.	train
train0243.mp3	I was busy yesterday, so I became very tired.	train

train0250.mp3	This essay is very well written.	train
train0251.mp3	Caught off guard, I couldn’t think of anything to say.	train
train0252.mp3	Mother always asks me to do her shopping.	train
train0253.mp3	It was inconsiderate of him to say such a thing to a sick person.	train
train0254.mp3	Not only is she beautiful, but she’s kind and intelligent.	train
train0255.mp3	Rather than being cold, she’s actually shy.	train
train0256.mp3	Do we need to wait for her?	train
train0257.mp3	They continued to eat as though nothing had happened.	train
train0258.mp3	She didn’t like using a writing brush.	train

train0264.mp3	She fell from the tree.	train
train0265.mp3	Please give me an envelope.	train
train0266.mp3	I want you to clean your room quickly.	train
train0267.mp3	She’s just like her mother.	train
train0268.mp3	There are several superficial reasons.	train
train0269.mp3	One would think father would be happy, but he’s actually very angry.	train
train0270.mp3	The soldiers confiscated food from the people they conquered.	train
train0271.mp3	This clock must be expensive.	train
train0272.mp3	It’s against the law to carry a weapon.	train
train0273.mp3	Father will come home on the weekend.	train
train0274.mp3	After father’s death, he became the head of the company.	train

train0279.mp3	May I exit the room?	train
train0280.mp3	The beach is full of people.	train
train0281.mp3	She said she was sick.	train
train0282.mp3	If you turn left at that intersection, there will be an embassy.	train
train0283.mp3	He’s poor but he wouldn’t lie.	train
train0284.mp3	Father made a long tear in the sleeve.	train
train0285.mp3	There were almost nobody in the room.	train
train0286.mp3	She’s doing great, isn’t she?	train
train0287.mp3	That supermarket is open at night, too.	train
train0288.mp3	Apparently, she’s unhappy.	train
train0289.mp3	Their facial expression was much softer after they became Prime Minister.	train
train0290.mp3	I recently went to Europe for the first time in a long time, albeit for a very short time.	train
train0291.mp3	Don’t get mad.	train
train0292.mp3	It’s on the third floor of this building.	train
train0293.mp3	Keep unexpected situations in mind.	train
train0294.mp3	Masked men attacked tourists and took their money.	train
train0295.mp3	I eat and then I brush my teeth.	train
train0296.mp3	One must not look down on poor people.	train
train0297.mp3	Father has gone out, but mother is at home.	train
train0298.mp3	She knitted a sweater for her father.	train
train0299.mp3	That’s right, the odd sounds were the death throes of the air conditioner fan.	train
train0300.mp3	I can’t help feeling sorry for him.	train
train0301.mp3	She speaks frankly.	train
train0302.mp3	I came to Japan on March 15th of this year.	train
train0303.mp3	Father will probably be at home tomorrow.	train
train0304.mp3	Unauthorized access should be cracked down on by law.	train
train0305.mp3	She helped an elderly person cross the street.	train
train0306.mp3	Mother’s cooking is delicious.	train
train0307.mp3	If there’s anything you don’t understand, ask me any time.	train
train0308.mp3	Commodity prices have come down.	train
train0309.mp3	She continued to speak calmly.	train
train0310.mp3	I think I understand.	train
train0311.mp3	You can sign up for a company tour at anytime, even after the company information session.	train
train0312.mp3	The soldiers countered the enemy attack.	train
train0313.mp3	She yelled as soon as she saw her mother.	train
train0314.mp3	I can’t get rid of this cold.	train
train0315.mp3	That restaurant is inexpensive. But the food is not very good.	train
train0316.mp3	It’s hot in the summer, so I don’t want to wear a suit.	train
train0317.mp3	Reading literary critiques is very useful for understanding literature.	train
train0318.mp3	We were very close and visited each other’s home often.	train
train0319.mp3	The wind has picked up, hasn’t it?	train
train0320.mp3	After her husband’s death, she raised their two children alone.	train

train0328.mp3	In Japan, it snows in the winter.	train
train0329.mp3	I have to do this job by the 10th.	train
train0330.mp3	A good idea came to me when I was taking a bath.	train
train0331.mp3	That belongs to Tanaka-san.	train
train0332.mp3	You must not talk to your neighbor during class.	train
train0333.mp3	I don’t want to draw the shortest straw.	train
train0334.mp3	It’s rare to see such a lifeless, quiet, and solemn ceremonial toss of an honored person into the air.	train
train0335.mp3	With eyes full of tears, she waved goodbye.	train
train0336.mp3	She walked with her head down, like an old woman.	train
train0337.mp3	She is very particular about clothing.	train
train0338.mp3	In Japan, you can drive from age 18.	train
train0339.mp3	It’s dangerous, so you can’t come in here.	train
train0340.mp3	This is the third year since I got my driver’s license.	train
train0341.mp3	The aliens agreed with this opinion and clapped with all of their hands.	train
train0342.mp3	She doesn’t like baseball very much.	train
train0343.mp3	The reason is very clear, and it’s because I’m bad at giving speeches.	train
train0344.mp3	She’s always looking for faults in her husband.	train
train0345.mp3	This descending part here does not have a hand rail, so it’s dangerous.	train
train0346.mp3	She was walking around in the room.	train
train0347.mp3	Note that the obligation will continue after the authorization notice and after the issuing fee is paid.	train
train0348.mp3	They are showing various signs of illness.	train
train0349.mp3	Father won first place in a photography contest and was in high spirits.	train
train0350.mp3	What’s the best medicine for a cold?	train
train0351.mp3	She is truly beautiful.	train
train0352.mp3	Once we entered the room, we started talking again.	train
train0353.mp3	Our dog is really cute.	train
train0354.mp3	“Trust me,” he said.	train
train0355.mp3	Most books go to bookstores via major distributors, but more than a few are quickly returned and then disappear.	train
train0356.mp3	The products will be sent to you on a cash on delivery basis.	train
train0357.mp3	I played in that park often as a child.	train
train0358.mp3	I agree with the opinion that real estate is too expensive.	train
train0359.mp3	Write in pen.	train
train0360.mp3	Civilization is progressing very quickly.	train

train0362.mp3	She will probably be late to dinner.	train
train0363.mp3	There is a vase in the entrance area.	train
train0364.mp3	With air conditioning, overcooling is an issue.	train
train0365.mp3	One day is very short.	train
train0366.mp3	We arrived there, and we requested indigenous people who would carry us in a pinch. These were the Pygmies.	train
train0367.mp3	I believe China will play a more proactive role.	train
train0368.mp3	In July, it starts to get hotter, gradually.	train
train0369.mp3	Normally, we correct our thinking in university.	train
train0370.mp3	Which teacher’s class is the most interesting?	train
train0371.mp3	Tomorrow, Kimura-san and I will go to the pool.	train
train0372.mp3	I buy fruit and vegetables at the vegetable store.	train
train0373.mp3	She’s used to cooking.	train
train0374.mp3	In its natural state, hair contains oil.	train
train0375.mp3	The wind made ripples on the surface of the water.	train
train0376.mp3	I sometimes go to that bookstore.	train
train0377.mp3	I gazed at her face in an attempt to seduce her.	train
train0378.mp3	She’s not smart but she has a nice body.	train
train0379.mp3	The bag wasn’t closed.	train
train0380.mp3	I always take three pencils to school.	train
train0381.mp3	This bag has pockets on the outside.	train
train0382.mp3	The supermarket was closed, so I couldn’t shop.	train
train0383.mp3	For a second, I thought a burglar had entered.	train
train0384.mp3	Father hardly ever does anything extreme.	train
train0385.mp3	Almost nobody lives past one hundred.	train
train0386.mp3	They have differing opinions but they get along as always.	train
train0387.mp3	I’m planning to travel overseas next year.	train

train0394.mp3	She wears makeup every day.	train
train0395.mp3	Father didn’t say a single word during dinner.	train
train0396.mp3	We must provide food and clothing to the poor.	train
train0397.mp3	Kimura-san is standing there.	train
train0398.mp3	It’s cool in the mornings and evenings, so I want to be careful about clothing.	train
train0399.mp3	Father was asleep the whole time during that movie.	train
train0400.mp3	Don’t kill anyone not involved!	train
train0401.mp3	She’s likely to wait for days and days, but he probably won’t return.	train
train0402.mp3	This black tea is hot.	train
train0403.mp3	She said, “Go to the hospital” and wouldn’t take no for an answer.	train
train0404.mp3	We thought it would be wrong to leave her alone.	train
train0405.mp3	There are many girls in the room.	train
train0406.mp3	This road bends.	train
train0407.mp3	I was exhausted so all I could think about was sleeping.	train
train0408.mp3	Small animals are very cute.	train
train0409.mp3	She accommodated his request.	train
train0410.mp3	She’s afraid of barking dogs.	train
train0411.mp3	She held back her tears.	train
train0412.mp3	Their job is to read the news with clear attention.	train
train0413.mp3	She is always complaining.	train
train0414.mp3	Distracted driving causes accidents.	train
train0415.mp3	Last week, I went to a cinema with Lee-san and watched a movie.	train
train0416.mp3	They’ll come if they’re not ill.	train
train0417.mp3	Father let that person enter the study.	train
train0418.mp3	There was no choice but to wait for her.	train
train0419.mp3	I gave Kimura’s phone number to my friend.	train
train0420.mp3	Father will surely help us.	train
train0421.mp3	Sentences usually contain a subject and a verb.	train
train0422.mp3	It’s already 7:30, so I need to leave my home.	train
train0423.mp3	There are eight stamps here.	train
train0424.mp3	Unlike the wife, the husband did not appear to be enjoying shopping.	train
train0425.mp3	She was trained to be a secretary.	train
train0426.mp3	She must have been beautiful.	train
train0427.mp3	It’s a starlit sky and the clouds flowing through it are beautiful.	train
train0428.mp3	They invited me to a meal.	train
